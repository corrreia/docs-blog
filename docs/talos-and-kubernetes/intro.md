# Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying [Talos](https://talos.dev/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) on your homelab.

This is made in conjunction with my [blog post](/blog/kubernetes-at-home/) on my journey to set up Kubernetes at home.

By the end of this guide, you should have a working Talos and Kubernetes setup with everything configured properly and ready to start deploying applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Somewhere to deploy to, it could be a physical server, a virtual machine, or a cloud provider even.
- Basic knowledge of Linux and command-line tools
- Familiarity with Kubernetes concepts and architecture
